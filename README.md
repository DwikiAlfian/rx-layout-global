# rexothyst Global CSS Layouting
This is CSS layout code for every CSS theme library that I created

## How it work:
For Example, creating a 2 column grid.
The analogy is like this :
`Grid Column 2`
If we're gonna turn that analogy into CSS code, it should be look like this :
`.rx-grid-column-2`
Then, let's shortened the word into 2 first letters:
`.rx-gr-co-2`

If the specific element has 2 words, the it's should look like this:
`Flex Column Space-Between`
CSS Code:
`.rx-flex-column-space_between`
How to shortened it:
`.rx-fl-co-sb`

So if there are 2 words in the element, we took only the first letter of each word
