# rexothyst Global CSS Layouting
This is CSS layout code for every CSS theme library that I created

## How it work:
For Example, creating a 2 column grid. <br>
The analogy is like this : <br>
`Grid Column 2`<br>
If we're gonna turn that analogy into CSS code, it should be look like this :<br>
`.rx-grid-column-2`<br>
Then, let's shortened the word into 2 first letters:<br>
`.rx-gr-co-2`<br>
<br>
If the specific element has 2 words, which look like this:<br>
`Flex Column Space-Between`<br>
CSS Code:<br>
`.rx-flex-column-space_between`<br>
How to shortened it:<br>
`.rx-fl-co-sb`<br>

So if there are 2 words in the element, we took only the first letter of each word

<br>
To create a responsive elements, add the number of the screen resolution after 
`.rx-`:<br>
`.rx-700-fl-co-sb`<br>

<br>
* Note that not every class is available for responsiveness
* And also, screen resolution is limited from 200px to 1400px. 100px each multiplication
